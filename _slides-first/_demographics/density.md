This map estimates population numbers per 10,000 m<sup>2</sup> grid cell. It provides a more consistent representation of population distributions across different landscapes than administrative unit counts. Knowing where people are is critical for impact assessments and intervention plans, especially those focused on service delivery, food security, climate change, network systems and natural disasters.
