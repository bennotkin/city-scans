Population figures are typically used as a denominator for many indicators, and are a measure of demand for services. The line chart above summarizes the city’s population change according to census and other public data. High growth of urban populations, caused by rates of natural increase (more births than deaths) in urban areas, migration from rural to urban areas, and the transformation of rural settlements into urban places, puts pressure on cities to meet the new demand.

This column chart classifies the city’s population according to age group, forming the basis of population projections. Populations vary significantly in their proportions of young and old people, with growing populations generally appearing younger, and declining or slowly growing populations generally appearing older.
